# LearnFlow AI
## Adaptive Multi-Agent Personal Tutor & Personalized Learning Platform

LearnFlow AI is an AI-powered adaptive learning platform that transforms multimodal course material such as PDFs, PPTX presentations, and lecture recordings into a structured, source-grounded learning environment.

It uses an **8-agent LangGraph architecture** to provide grounded tutoring, adaptive assessments, misconception diagnosis, real-time learner modeling, and personalized next-best learning actions.

# 3. The 8 AI Agents

### Agent 1 — Multimodal Ingestion Agent

Processes:

- PDF textbooks
- PPTX presentations
- Lecture video transcripts

Preserves exact source metadata including:

- source name
- page number
- slide number
- video timestamp

### Agent 2 — Knowledge Organization Agent

Converts unstructured learning material into:

```text
Course
 └── Topic
      └── Subtopic
           └── Concept
                └── Prerequisites
```

It also builds the prerequisite dependency graph used by the tutor and personalization system.

### Agent 3 — Grounded Tutor Agent

Provides source-grounded answers using RAG.

Features include:

- Semantic retrieval
- Source verification
- Clickable citations
- Source Viewer
- Out-of-domain refusal

Example:

```text
[Algorithms_Textbook.pdf — Page 42]
[Lecture_03_Searching.mp4 — 14:22]
```

### Agent 4 — Assessment Generation Agent

Generates:

- MCQs
- Programming/problem-solving questions
- Conceptual questions

Questions are calibrated according to:

- Topic
- Learner mastery
- Difficulty
- Previous performance

### Agent 5 — Question Verification Agent

Before a question reaches the learner, the agent verifies:

- Single correct answer
- Clarity
- Source alignment
- Pedagogical quality

Invalid questions enter:

```text
Reject → Regenerate → Verify → Present
```

### Agent 6 — Misconception Analysis Agent

Analyzes incorrect answers and identifies the underlying conceptual mistake.

Instead of simply saying:

> "Wrong answer."

It identifies the likely misconception and provides targeted remediation.

### Agent 7 — Learner Model Agent

Maintains a real-time learner mastery model.

Mastery scores are maintained between:

```text
0.05 ≤ Mastery ≤ 0.99
```

The model considers:

- Previous performance
- Question difficulty
- Mistakes
- Topic-level understanding

### Agent 8 — Personalization Agent

Uses the learner model to generate **Next Best Actions**.

Possible recommendations:

```text
Foundational Review
        ↓
Intermediate Practice
        ↓
Challenge Quiz
```

Each recommendation includes a pedagogical explanation of **WHY** it was selected.

# 15. Core Learning Philosophy

LearnFlow AI is designed around a simple principle:

**Don't just answer the learner's question. Understand what they know, identify what they don't know, and decide what they should learn next.**

The system continuously follows:

```text
CONTENT
   ↓
UNDERSTANDING
   ↓
PRACTICE
   ↓
ASSESSMENT
   ↓
MISCONCEPTION
   ↓
MASTERY UPDATE
   ↓
PERSONALIZATION
   ↓
NEXT BEST ACTION
   ↓
MASTER
```

This creates a continuous adaptive learning loop rather than a conventional chatbot experience.
